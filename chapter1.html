FUTURE AND SPECULATION</p>

<p>



Speculation<br>
Design terms like, for instance, speculative and critical are, in use, furnarable of being perceived as pretentious hollow shells used in a specific design elite’s jargon. To avoid this we will look at the terminology of speculative design before going into its practices. 
The verb to speculate comes from late 16th century latin speculātus, which means: watch over, explore. It’s a derivate of specula, meaning watch-tower, which in its turn comes from specere: to look, to regard [5]. 
To speculate has multiple meanings. The first is: “to engage in thought or reflection”. The second is: “to indulge in conjectural thought”, so the act of, in thought, formulating an opinion or theory without sufficient evidence or proof. The third meaning of speculation is a financial one: “to engage in any business transaction involving considerable risk or the chance of large gains, especially to buy and sell commodities, stocks, etc., in the expectation of a quick or very large profit.“. So, like in the second meaning of the word, you engage in an act that you do not know the except outcome of. In finance this could be investing money without the certainty of profit. In research it could be, coming up with an explanation for a problem or thinking of a possible future scenario without having empiric evidence to backup the assertion. In finances speculation is often connected with gaining large amounts of money. This may sound like gambling but there is a little difference. The speculant uses strategies or tactics to make guesses. In gambling the outcome is always random. <br>
So what does speculative mean when we put it in front of design? Is the design itself speculative? Does the work provoke speculation? Is the way of speculation designed? Or does the designer make choices based on only speculations? Before we can answer this question we have to visit the future. Not the real future. just the concept of the future. Not all speculative design explicitly deals with the future. But a big portion of it does.
<br><br>
The Future<br>
The future is a time that will happen after the present. The future is the not yet and about to be. The future is something we can’t escape because the passing of time is inevitable. In western culture time is envisioned as a linear passing of events. Symbolically the past is on the left, the future is on the right. The future is something that will always stay unreal, it never is, for the time of our experience always always be in the present. When we reminisce times of the past or imagine the future, we stay in the present. Because our current understanding of the laws of physics tells us it is impossible to travel back and forth in time. 
<br><br>
The future is always a big factor of uncertainty in our lives, its inevitable and unknown nature could even evoke anxiety. This is one of the main reasons people have been always willing to uncover the future. Prophets, seers and soothsayers have claimed to have seen the future. although science has never such claims, there is a scientific study towards the future called futurology. Futurologists try to predict or forecast the future with the use of scientific models. They try to work in a scientific way: use as much real data and use a little assumptions as possible. However, in the futurological community, there is consensus about the impossibility to predict the future. It is currently impossible to account for all factors influencing the course events leading to the future. Because of this, futurology focuses on creating multiple models for possible futures instead of predicting one monolithic future.
<br><br>
The future and speculation stay tightly connected. The future is unknown and even the science that tries to uncover parts does not come further than broad suggestions. Talking about the future will stay speculation. gut feelings, presumptions, informed- and wild guesses. 
<br><br>
Another category of speculative future is retrofuturism [6]. Retrofuturism is a cultural phenomena that involves future ideas of the past. retrofuturism could be subdivided in two overlapping categories: retrofuturism and futuristic retro:
Retrofuturism involves futures as they were envisioned in the past. We can also talk about them as futures that never were. These futures often give us a strange feeling of nostalgia since they exist in a nospace of future and past at the same time. <br>
An example of retrofuturism could be architectural styles Googie, Raygun Gothic and Streamline Moderne [7]. These styles were both futuristic in their time. Googie architecture often involves light-feeling glass construction combined with dynamic arched curves and star shapes. A style later caricaturized in the jetsons. The style originated in the 1940’s, A time when new technologies like jet engines, nuclear energy and space travel gave people the feeling they were entering a new era. Googie architecture resonated with this feeling. The same goes for Streamline Moderne, massive glass or light-colored stone building with rounded corners. They seem to be build for a society that never existed. William Gibson perfectly describes the alienating relation we can have with this kind of architecture in his short story, the gernsback continuum [8]. A photographer is commissioned to photograph Streamline Moderne architecture and gets lured into the schizophrenic nospace of a “tomorrow that never was”, bringing him feverish daydreams of the perfect people that could have inhabited this space.<br>
Another example of retrofuturism is the music/internet phenomenon of vaporwave [9]. Vaporwave uses the futuristic nostalgia from the early days of the internet combined with muzak from capitalist nospaces like the office, the training video or the shopping mall. By twisting and changing this muzak vaporwave artists try to exaggerate the alienating and hyperreal properties of the virtual plaza. A reimagining of a future from the past.
The other side of retrofuturism is futuristic retro. Futuristic retro looks at styles from past times and imagines how it would be if modern technologies would be around in these days. An example of this would be styles like steampunk. Steampunk takes the aesthetic of late 19th century steam-engines and cogwheel-machinery and imagines modern technology on top of it. Creating anachronic or alternative histories like cowboys flying steam powered planes. 
<br><br>
Retrofuturism shows us a number of important ideas on future speculation. It shows future speculations could also be situated in the past, by being voluntary anachronisms or by showing a outdated speculations. Half future, half past, but certainly not present. Both forms of speculative futures could be meaningful places to visit. Secondly it shows speculations from the past have not always become reality but served a purpose, googie embodied peoples feelings of progression but also critiqued those insofar as they were never realized. Lastly, it slow there have been speculations in the past, something we will explore in the next chapter.
