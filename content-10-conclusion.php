What can graphic designers learn from the history of future speculation?
<br>

<br>
First of all, don’t worry about failing to predict the future. Speculation is the act of formulation a theory or idea based on assumptions. In speculative design these theories/ideas are about the future, or another place that doesn’t exist yet. The future is inevitably unknowable. Therefore, we have to rely on speculation when envisioning its course.
<br>

<br>
Secondly, think about the function your speculation has. Graphic designers don’t always want to create the same effect with their designs. The different functions of speculation give a range of possibilities to consider. Speculations could be purely practical predictions or mere entertainment. However, speculations could also be a way to evoke a wider range of emotions. These could be positive emotions, such as pride about what we have or are going to accomplish. But it could also evoke negative emotions like fear, which could serve as warnings. Speculations can make us think about the future, about where we would like to be, and where we wouldn’t. Speculations can also be a covert way to make people reflect on the now, or criticize the way things are going. It is also possible to create a more complex speculation by layering these functions. We saw this happen in science fiction literature and the overlapping genres of utopian- and dystopian fiction. Utopian/eutopian/dystopian literature also taught us you don’t always have to be super clear in saying a scenario is preferable or not. Sometimes it is more interesting to let people judge themselves, or show that there are more sides to a story.
<br>

<br>
Third, think about the method you will apply to speculate. We have seen that there are as many methods of speculating as reasons why to do so. Taken together these methods could be summed-up in top-down and bottom-up approaches. With top-down approaches, you start with the large structures that make up a world and fill in the gaps from there. With the bottom-up approaches, you start from a single idea and build a world around extrapolating the consequences. 
<br>

<br>
Fourth, combine abstract topics with entertainment and exciting visuals. By combining high intellectual excitement with high emotional excitement, you can appeal to a broad audience. Some will be directly tempted by the deeper questions, but some need to be lured in with entertainment. This is a trick we can learn from science fiction. 
<br>

<br>
And finally, make use of the expertises graphic design already possesses. Graphic design is sometimes called practical and commercial but in speculative practices graphic designers should take full advantage of these characteristics. Graphic designers should exploit their expertise in the media they commonly use and their knowledge of visualising and selling ideas. Selling ideas in visual languages people are already familiar with only benefits the communicative process.
