Of all applied arts, graphic design is the discipline struggling hardest to lose its image of being practical and business oriented [1]. In fashion design, for instance, it is broadly accepted of designers to present garments that are unwearable in daily life. The garment designs are in turn intended to inspire or to communicate a statement. Architecture is another example of an applied art with a rich intellectual and theoretical tradition. The practice does not limit itself to what is actually built there is space for experimentation and theoretical research–something the discipline draws its status from.
<br>

<br>
With graphic design, this is different. Graphic design is traditionally seen as a serving profession with a strict division of roles[2]. The graphic designer is merely a link in a commercial production chain. At the start of the chain is the client. The client needs the graphic designer to add value to a product so it can be sold to the consumer with a maximal profit. In return, the designer expects the client to supply him with work and an income.
<br>

<br>
This traditional image of graphic design doesn't necessarily correspond to reality. Many graphic designers nowadays work partially or entirely autonomous and initiate their own projects. [1][2] Projects in which they, next to the role of designer, take on various roles of, for instance, researcher, producer, thinker, editor, writer, programmer and artist. These projects offer the designer a space for artistic and theoretical exploration. This lets the designer engage in experimentations that could question the practice and values of graphic design itself, or turn into projects that are more focused on specific social issues.
<br>

<br>
The design world already is familiar with subgenres of design that operate outside the commercial world: critical design, design fiction, design futures, anti-design, design for debate and radical design, to name a few [3]. These forms of design aren't strictly fully separated categories. These subgenres merely serve as general definitions for designers to describe what they are doing.
<br>

<br>
A form of design that has recently gotten more attention is speculative design. Speculative design envisions scenarios on future technologies that do not exist yet. In a broader interpretation, speculative design creates completely different worlds that provoke and broaden our view of what is possible. Speculative design uses design to present these scenario’s, in which it differentiates itself from for instance <i>design fiction</i>, which uses narrative elements to present the future of design [4].
<br>

<br>
What could explain the growing interest for speculative design is the acceleration of technological innovation in the past decades [5]. Computer technology is omnipresent and we are becoming more and more dependent on it. Devices are getting smaller, smarter and more powerful. The internet is growing and more people, things and knowledge is getting connected to it. These innovations are gradually changing us, our behaviours and our surroundings. This impact gives rise to a lot of debate: optimists see new possibilities for future innovations, critics call for caution in the changes that might follow
<br>

<br>
This is where speculative design can step into the picture. Speculative designs could function as a window into the worlds of tomorrow. First of all, speculative design can provoke our imagination and thus stimulate ideas for new solutions. Ideas might be more realisable than before, because of current technological progress. Secondly, by showing us different possible scenarios, it can make us think of how preferable a particular outcome of the future might be to us. Thirdly, it can reveal certain tendencies of the present. Finally, by being confronted with worlds that aren’t existing right now,—no matter if they are closer to dream or nightmare—we become conscious of the world we currently live in. The comparison between both worlds gives us a starting point for a discussion about the changes we want to make and what to improve or maintain. In short, speculative design can guide change by making us contemplate about the times we live in now, and inspire us to think about better ways of shaping our world.
<br>

<br>
Speculative design isn’t only interesting for it’s potential as a useful tool for thinking about a changing world, it is the product of it, too. Technological changes disrupted the traditional design practice. The growth of the internet opened up new possibilities for the distribution and financing of projects. Design tools became more accessible and design knowledge easier to find. This wasn’t only beneficial for designers, but also amateurs could start designing themselves [6]. These shifts started to put traditional design conventions under pressure and started questioning designers about their values and intentions. This made designers reconsider the future of their profession and caused them to try out new forms of working.
<br>

<br>
Although speculative design has been often discussed in the general design discourse, it is not yet that much talked about in graphic design discipline in particular. In the general design field, speculative practices are better described, discussed and documented. In graphic design, it is still not clear what we could expected from speculative practices.
<br>

<br>
In this text I would like to explore speculative design and put it into a broader context. I will mainly investigate the historical background of speculative practices to see if there will be things to learn. First, we will look from a historical perspective at the way people used to speculate about possible futures. Afterwards, we will look at some “schoolbook examples” of speculative projects. Then, we will go into speculative design a little bit more extensively. To finish, I will answer the question: “What are the lessons speculative graphic design can learn, looking at speculative practices from a historical perspective?”
