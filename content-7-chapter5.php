Ideological Builders

</p>

<p>

<span id="fut1">Futurism</span> was a avant-garde art movement in <span id="fut2">Italy</span> at the beginning of the 20th century [33]. The movement’s aim wasn't to predict the future. Its aim was to reject all conservatism in art and embrace the industrial machine aesthetics of the 20th century, glorifying <span id="fut3">speed, acceleration, technology, youth and violence. The movement was launched with Filippo <span id="marinetti">Marinetti’s</span> futurist manifesto, in which he stated: 
<br>
“<i>We stand on the last promontory of the centuries!... Why should we look back, when what we want is to break down the mysterious doors of the Impossible? Time and Space died yesterday. We already live in the absolute, because we have created eternal, omnipresent speed.</i>” [34]
<br>
Marinetti was a <span id="poem">poet</span> but other disciplines joined the movement by writing their specific manifestoes.
<br>
Although it took the futurists some time to find a common style they managed to find a way to translate their ideas of fast-paced violence of the industrial age. Their paintings showing movement, racing cars, man and machine merging into a flow of hard geometric shapes of light. Painter Giacomo Balla wrote: 
<br>
“<i>No one thought a normal electric light could be an inspiring object to a painter. I want to prove romantic moonlight could be beaten by the light of the <span id="balla">electric</span> light</i>”. [33]
<br>
Futurism was a strong ideological movement. An ideology that, shared a lot of ideas with fascism and, ironically enough, glorified patriotism and war. A war that came and left many futurists dead or severely traumatised. 
<br>

<br>
Constant Nieuwenhuys was an artist that also wanted to embrace technology. But in contrast to the futurists, Constant wanted to apply the technology to make the world a better place[35][36]. He envisioned a anti-capitalist society where, as Sarah Goldhagen puts it, 
<br>
“<i>The post-revolutionary individual would wander from one leisure environment to another in search of new sensations. Beholden to no one, he would sleep, eat, recreate, and procreate where and when he wanted. Self-fulfillment and self-satisfaction were Constant's social goals. Deductive reasoning, goal-oriented production, the construction and betterment of a political community--all these were eschewed</i>” [37]. 
<br>
The inhabitant of this world would be the <i>Homo Ludens</i>, the playing man, from a concept of Dutch historian Johan Huizinga. Constant called the world <span id="newbabylon">New</span> Babylon and visually presented it in paintings and maquettes. 
<br>

<br>
Constant’s Utopic vision spoke to a lot of young architects. At the same time of Constant’s developing of New Babylon, avant-garde architecture studios started to develop radical new ideas of future cities, among them the collective Archigram [38][39][40][41]. Archigram developed hypothetical projects in which they explored new ways of designing building often starting from a technological view. With technology conventions of static architecture were challegent. A city could be one big moving vehicle as we see in Archigram's project: The <span id="archigram">Walking City, or a city could be a framework in which modular buildings could be plugged in and out, as we see in: Plug-In city.
<br>
Archigram's projects where hypothetical but not impossible, they were all technological plausible scenarios meant to challenge the view on what was possible.
<br>
The Italian studio Superstudio and Archizoom pushed the boundaries even further, posing alternative models for looking at space and setting up the conditions for new societies [39][40][42]. Thinking of technology on an even more philosophical and ideological level. Hoping to create a <span id="superstudio">world</span> free of material boundaries where alternative communities could live a life of total freedom. 
<br>
Superstudio imagined a all encompassing grid extending across the entire surface of the planet, that served as a metaphor of how we could new rational ways of resource distribution.
<br>

<br>
With the futurists came an embrace of the technological future. Technology would change our world and we had to be ready to change. With Constant and the radical architects of Archigram, Archizoom and Superstudio, we see the transformation of the utopian concept from story to blueprint. Ideology driven proposals for the real world, visualised in maquettes and graphic renders. These examples also show us that, although literature is a very fruitful medium to show fictional world through narrative, design also offers possibilities for showing theories and ideas about the future.
