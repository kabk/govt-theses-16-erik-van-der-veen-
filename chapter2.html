THE HISTORY OF FUTURE SPECULATION</p>

<p>
Even in the early days of civilization, humans have been speculating about, and imagining their future. This was done in a number of different manners. Sometimes in the form of predictions of prophets and soothsayers, later in philosophical essays and works of fiction. These future images didn’t always serve the same purpose. Some were meant to be predictions that were expected to come into reality. others served as alternative realities that that were meant to provoke contemplation on the current reality. What these worlds had in common was that they showed us worlds that weren't real yet but had the possibility of becoming reality.
<br><br>
The cave painting in lascaux could be seen as the earliest material clue of an image that depicted the future. According to one of the interpretations, the paintings were produced to enhance the change of a prosperous hunt. If the hunters depicted the catching of the animal, their chances of success improved. This shows these hunters did not only had a notion of an complex idea like “the future”, they were also aware they could influence it. It remains a question if the visualisations where strategic or ritualistic in nature. 
<br><br>
The first written futures could be found in the sacred scriptures of the jews[10]. The jewish people lacked a glorious past to be proud of. because of this, they relied on the predictions of prophets to boost their collective self-esteem. according to these prophecies, the jews were awaiting a grand future. They had a special place in God's plan. The past was interpreted in retrospect as a series of fulfilled prophecies on the way till God would proclaim His Holy Kingdom. In this case we see the predicting of the future serves the purpose of giving feelings of hope and pride. 
<br><br>
Predictions can also have a practical value. The Greek doctor Hippocrates wrote about his in 400 B.C. Hippocrates called the art of prediction an excellent activity for physicians. When a doctor was able to predict the course of a disease, he would be prepared for what was still coming. There wasn’t enough time to heal every patient. It was efficient to predict which patient was surely going to die. No energy had to be wasted on hopeless cases. 
<br><br>
Plato, a contemporary of Hippocrates, used his book The Republic to put forward his design for the perfect society [12]. The Republic isn’t a prediction but a proposal for an alternative, that could exist, and according to Plato, should exist. 
<br><br>
Plato’s approach might look rational, but not all of his contemporaries were like this. In ancient rome, there was a strong believe the future could be revealed by all kind of seers. These soothsayers used all kind of inherited techniques for prediction. These techniques were once based on empirical observations lost their original meaning over time. Previous generations would, for instance, look at the sky and the flight behavior of birds to forecast the weather, or look at the organs of deceased cattle to determine the cause of death. The roman seers like augur or haruspex used the same predictors like ,flight behavior and animal organs, to predict all kind of unrelated business. Throught these rituals the seers communicated visions about the will of the gods or predictions on economy.
The were so dependant on predictions that even the senate consulted a book of predictions. These Sibylline Books were once bought by the “half-legendary” king Tarquinius Superbus and were full of Greek hexametric verses [11]. The books were exclusively meant for use by the senate but the Roman population also wanted to profit from these verses. This gave rise to a false market in false copies of the book. For safety reasons the senate ordered the burning of 2000 of these copies in 12 B.C.. <br>
Lucianus of Samosata found this course of affairs absurd in such a way he wrote the satirical novel: The True History. The book dealt with future predictions that were meant to entertain and critique simultaneously. It contains ideas about extraterrestrial life and travels to mars and venus. Two decennia before its invention, it can be seen as the first work of science fiction.
<br><br>
Utopia<br>
In 1516 Thomas More published Utopia [13]. In this book, More tells us about the land of Utopia, of which the social and legal organisation seem to be perfect. Utopia isn’t a future prediction, On the contrary, More puts the country in the present, even in a physical place on earth, the new world, the just discovered Americas. <br>
The book takes the shape of a conversation More has with traveler Raphael Hythlodaeus. Hythlodaeus is born is from Utopia and is willing to tell more and his friend all about it. The description is very detailed. Every part of the Utopian society is being described. This all creates a feeling Utopia is a real place. nevertheless, More supplies the reader with smart hints that show Utopia is a fictional place. U-topia is Greek for Non-Place. Hythlodaeus, the name of More’s Utopian friend is greek for “dispenser of nonsense”. The Utopian names are filled with these kind of clues. 
There has in the past been a lot of discussion on More’s intentions. Some believe More wanted to show us a blueprint for the perfect society. Something More deeply believed in as being the best possible option for humanity, something we should all strive for. According to some More tries to propagate an early form of communist ideology. This interpretation is the most easy reading and some say it overlooks its complexed layers structure.<br>
More’s book could also be seen as a inventive way of critique.More himself was a big fan of Lucians satirical work but being critical or satirical wasn’t that easy in 16th century England. A minor disagreement with the king could get you killed or thrown in jail. Utopia was More’s way to covertly comment on the england of his days. By showing a world in which everything was perfectly organised, he silently showed what reality was lacking. The contrast made the chaos and absurdity of 16th century england apparent. 
<br><br>
Although More’s book is not a future prediction, it has been very influential to the field of speculative fiction. Utopian fiction has become a genre in itself. The name of More’s fictional country is nowadays a synonym for “the perfect society”. For More this perfect society wasn't necessarily positioned in the future. But it’s possible existence makes it a potential future depending on how preferable it is. 
<br><br>
On the opposite of the utopia, the concept of the dystopia emerged. The dystopia is the antonym of the utopia, the name meaning “not good place”. The word was first used by English philosopher J. S. Mills in a speech addressing the bad policies of the Irish government. Since then the word has been used for undesirable models of society. Dystopias commonly contain totalitarian governments, post-apocalyptic anarchistic wastelands, catastrophic environmental disasters and dehumanization. The worlds are commonly but not necessarily set in the future. Dystopians can be found in novels, movies and videogames. 
<br><br>
The most famous examples are George Orwell’s 1984 and Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World. 
The dystopia can have a number of functions. A lot of dystopia function as a warning. The author might see a trend occurring he perceives as dangerous. To show the public the dangers of the trend, the writer constructs an exaggerated version of this trend. We see this structure very clearly in the British television series Black Mirror [13]. The show takes trends surrounding smartphone and social media use and exaggerates them to absurd levels, creating disturbing scenarios that might serve as a warning.
Also 1984 follows the classic structure of a world in which mass surveillance and censorship have gone to extreme levels. The book shows a place no one would ever like to be, serving as a critique on communism [14]. <br>
But some dystopia follow a much more complex approach. Huxley’s society in his novel Brave New World really challenges the line between utopia and dystopia [15]. The world he describes is somehow perfect. Everyone has its function and place in society, everything is controlled and taken care of. Society is designed to create an happy and carefree existence for every inhabitant. This is being payed for by loss of freedom and cultural depth. People are constructed in conveyor belt assembly line factories where their class and function is determined. Everyone gets brainwashed during sleep by slogans that play on repeat while they sleep. The state supplies everyone with a daily dose of drugs that will keep you in a pleasant mood. The book follows a couple of inhabitants of this world, among them a couple of misfits. The world is shown from different viewpoints. This structure questions the idea of the utopia and dystopia itself. What might be heaven for some might be a hell for others.<br>
Utopic and dystopic show us ingenious examples of more complex methods of thinking about the future. It doesn't always have to be clear at once if scenario is preferable or not.
