Future & Speculation

</p>

<p>

Speculation
<br>
Design terms like speculative and critical are, in practice, vulnerable of being perceived as pretentious hollow shells used in a specific design elite’s jargon. To avoid this form of use, we will look at the terminology of speculative design before going into its practices. 
<br>
The verb <i>to speculate</i> comes from late 16th century latin <i>speculātus</i>, which means: watch over, explore. It’s a derivate of specula, meaning watch-tower, which comes from <i>specere</i>: to look, to regard [7]. 
<br>
To speculate has multiple meanings. The first is: “<i>to engage in thought or reflection</i>”. The second is: “<i>to indulge in conjectural thought</i>”, which is the act of formulating an opinion or theory without sufficient evidence. The third meaning of speculation is a financial one: “<i>to engage in any business transaction involving considerable risk or the chance of large gains, especially to buy and sell commodities, stocks, etc., in the expectation of a quick or very large profit.</i>”. Just like the second meaning of the word, one engages in an act one does not know the outcome of. In finance, this would be investing money without the certainty of profit. In research it could indicate the act of finding an explanation for a problem without having empiric evidence to backup the assertion. In finances, speculation is often connected with gaining large amounts of money. This may sound like gambling, yet there is a difference. The speculant uses strategies or tactics to make guesses. In gambling, the outcome is always left to chance. 
<br>
The meaning of ‘speculative’ in speculative design lies somewhere between the second and third definition. It takes the freedom to imagine alternative worlds without having to backup the assumptions with facts. However, it might use certain strategies to make guesses. ‘What is the point of speculating if it isn’t supported by facts?’, you might ask. The answer to this question lies in the concept of the <i>Future</i>. 
<br>
 
<br>
The Future
<br>
The alternative worlds in speculative design are often situated in the future. The future is a time that will happen after the present. The future is the <i>not yet</i> and <i>about to be</i>. The future is something we can’t escape from, because the passing of time is inevitable. In western culture, time is envisioned as a linear passing of events. The future is something that will always stay abstract, it never <i>is</i> but always <i>will be</i> , for the time of our consciousness is always in the present. Even when we reminisce times of the past or imagine the future, we are in the present. Because our current understanding of the laws of physics tells us it is impossible to travel back and forth in time. 
<br>

<br>
The future is always a big factor of uncertainty in our lives, and its inevitable and unknown nature can even evoke anxiety. This is one of the main reasons people have been always willing to uncover the future. Prophets, seers and soothsayers have claimed to have seen it. Although science has never had such claims, there is a scientific study of the future named futurology. Futurologists try to predict or forecast the future with the use of scientific models. They try to work in a scientific way: use as much real data and use as little assumptions as possible. However, in the futurological community, there is consensus about the impossibility to predict the future. It is currently impossible to account for all factors influencing the course of events leading to the future. Because of this, futurology focuses on the creation of multiple models for possible futures instead of predicting one monolithic future.
<br>

<br>
The future and speculation stay tightly intertwined. The future is unknown and even the science that tries to uncover parts does not come further than broad suggestions. Discussing the future will stay speculation, gut feelings, presumptions, informed and wild guesses. 
<br>

<br>
Another category of speculative future is <i>retrofuturism</i> [8]. Retrofuturism is a cultural phenomenon that involves future ideas of the past. Retrofuturism could be subdivided in two overlapping categories: retrofuturism and futuristic retro.
<br>
Retrofuturism involves futures as they were envisioned in the past. We can also describe them as futures that never were. These futures often give us a strange feeling of nostalgia, since they exist in a no-space of future and past at the same time. 
<br>
An example of retrofuturism could be architectural styles <i><span id="googie">Googie</span>, Raygun Gothic</i> and <i>Streamline Moderne</i> [9]. These styles were futuristic in their time. <i>Googie</i> architecture often involves light-feeling glass construction combined with dynamic arched curves and star shapes. This <span id="jetsons">style</span> was later caricaturized in <i>The Jetsons</i>. The style originated in the 1940’s; a time when new technologies like jet engines, nuclear energy and space travel gave people the feeling they were entering a new era. Googie architecture resonated with this feeling. The same goes for Streamline Moderne, massive glass or light-colored stone buildings with rounded corners. They seem to be built for a society that never existed. William Gibson perfectly describes the alienating relation we can have with this kind of architecture in his short story, <i>The Gernsback Continuum</i> [10]. A photographer is commissioned to photograph Streamline Moderne architecture and gets lured into the schizophrenic nospace of a “<i>tomorrow that never was</i>”, bringing him feverish daydreams of the perfect people that could have inhabited this space.
<br>
Another example of retrofuturism is the music/internet phenomenon of vaporwave [11]. <span id="vapor">Vaporwave</span> uses the futuristic nostalgia from the early days of the internet combined with muzak from capitalist no-spaces like the office, the training video or the shopping mall. By twisting and changing this muzak, vaporwave artists try to exaggerate the alienating and hyperreal properties of the virtual plaza. A reimagining of a future from the past.
<br>

<br>
The other side of retrofuturism is futuristic retro. Futuristic retro looks at styles from past times and imagines how it would be if modern technologies would be around in those days. An example of this are styles like <span id="steampunk">steampunk</span>. Steampunk takes the aesthetic of late 19th century steam-engines and cogwheel-machinery and imagines modern technology on top of it. They are creating anachronic or alternative histories, like cowboys flying steam powered planes. 
<br>

<br>
Retrofuturism shows us a number of important ideas on future speculation. It shows future speculations could also be situated in the past, by being voluntary anachronisms or by showing a outdated speculation. Half future, half past, but certainly not present. Both forms of speculative futures could be meaningful places to visit. Secondly, it shows speculations from the past have not always become reality but did serve a purpose: Googie embodied peoples feelings of progression, but also critiqued those insofar as they were never realized. Lastly, it shows there have been speculations in the past.
<br>

<br>
Concluding, the future is both inevitable and unknown. This makes people willing to predict it, which is unfortunately impossible. The only thing we can do is speculate and like futurism, come up with multiple scenarios.
