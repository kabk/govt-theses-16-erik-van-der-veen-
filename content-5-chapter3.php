The U/Eu/Dystopia

</p>

<p>

In 1516, Thomas More published <i><span id="more">Utopia</span></i> [16]. In this book, More tells us about the land of Utopia, of which the social and legal organisation seem to be perfect. <i>Utopia</i> isn’t a future prediction. On the contrary, More situates the country in the present, even in a physical place on earth: the new world, the just discovered Americas. 
<br>
The story is told through a conversation More has with traveler Raphael Hythlodaeus. Hythlodaeus is from Utopia and is willing to tell More and his friend all about it. His description is very detailed. Every part of the Utopian society is being described. You would almost think Utopia is real. Nevertheless, More supplies the reader with intelligent hints that indicate Utopia is a fictional place. U-topia is Greek for Non-Place. Hythlodaeus, the name of More’s Utopian friend is Greek for “dispenser of nonsense”. The Utopian names are filled with these kind of clues. 
<br>
There has been a lot of discussion on More’s intentions. Some believe More wanted to show us a blueprint of the perfect society—something More deeply believed in as the best possible option for humanity, something we should all strive for. Some even believe More tries to propagate an early form of communist ideology. This interpretation is the easiest one and some say it explains its complex layered structure.
<br>
More’s book could also be seen as an inventive way of critique. More himself was a big fan of Lucian’s satirical work, but being critical or satirical wasn’t that easy in 16th century England. A minor disagreement with the king could get you thrown in jail or even killed. <i>Utopia</i> was More’s way to covertly comment on the England of his days. By showing a world in which everything was perfectly organised, he silently showed what reality was lacking. The contrast made the chaos and absurdity of 16th century England apparent.

<br>
Although More’s book is not a future prediction, it has been very influential to the field of speculative fiction. Utopian fiction has become a genre in itself. The name of More’s fictional country is nowadays synonym for “the perfect society”. 
<br>
Opposed to the concept of utopia, the concept of the dystopia emerged. The dystopia is antonym of the utopia, the name meaning “not good place”. The word was first used by English philosopher J. S. Mills in a speech addressing the bad policies of the Irish government[17]. Since then the word has been used for undesirable models of society. Dystopias commonly contain totalitarian governments, post-apocalyptic anarchistic wastelands, catastrophic environmental disasters and dehumanization. The worlds are commonly but not necessarily set in the future. Dystopias can be found in novels, movies and videogames. It is also argued that the word utopia should be used as an umbrella term for both dystopia and eutopia [18]. Eutopia (good-place) should be used for good/desirable places.
<br>

<br>
The most famous examples of future dystopia in literature are George Orwell’s <i><span id="orwel">1984</span></i> and Aldous Huxley’s <i>Brave New World</i>. The dystopia can have a number of functions. Some dystopia function as a warning when the author observes a trend he perceives as dangerous. To show the public the dangers of the trend, the writer constructs an exaggerated version of it. We see this structure very clearly in the British television series <i>Black Mirror</i> [18]. The show takes trends surrounding smartphone and social media use and exaggerates them to absurd levels, creating disturbing scenarios that might serve as a warning.
<br>
George Orwell’s <i>1984</i> follows the classic structure of a world in which mass surveillance and censorship have gone to extreme levels [19]. The book shows a place no one would ever like to inhabit. 
<br>
Some dystopias follow a much more complex approach. Huxley’s society in his novel <i><span id="brave">Brave New World</span></i> really plays with the thin line between utopia and dystopia [20]. The world he describes is somehow perfect. People are constructed on a conveyor belt, their place in society defined before construction. Everything is controlled and taken care of. Society is designed to create a happy and carefree existence for every inhabitant. This is being payed for by loss of freedom and cultural depth. Brainwash during sleep by slogans that play on repeat while they sleep. The state supplies everyone with a daily dose of drugs that will keep them in a pleasant mood. The book follows a couple of inhabitants of this world, among which a couple of misfits. The world is shown from different viewpoints. This structure plays with the idea of the eutopia and dystopia itself. What might be heaven for some might be a hell for others.
<br>
Utopia and dystopia show us ingenious examples of more complex methods of thinking about the future. It doesn't always have to be clear at once if a scenario is preferable or not.
