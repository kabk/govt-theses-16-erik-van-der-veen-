Speculative design is a design niche that uses speculation to come up with possible future scenarios. This type of design has recently been getting more attention because of the present-day issues it taps into. The acceleration of technological innovation and the connected environmental costs raise questions about our future. Questions about the impact of these changes on society, but also questions about the new roles and practices of design in general and graphic design in particular. In this thesis, I reflect on the history of speculation to see if there are things to learn for speculative practices in graphic design. 
<br>
The future is inevitably uncertain. Because of this, people have always been wanting to uncover it. In ancient times, this used to be the job of prophets, seers and soothsayers. Later on, writers started exploring possible futures in their literature. The most famous genres of speculative fiction are utopian, dystopian, and more recently science fiction. Genres that inspired artists and designers to come up with their own scenarios and materialise them. Speculative scenarios from the past teach us a couple of things. 
<br>
Speculative future scenarios can have a number of functions. They can evoke emotions, both positive and negative. Positive emotions can inspire people. Negative emotions can serve to warn people of certain futures. In literature, speculative future scenarios were also often used as a covert way of reflecting on/criticizing the now. In utopian/dystopian fiction, we often see more complex, layered structures. Sometimes it is left open to the reader to decide if the described scenario is preferable. Graphic designers can use these different functions when thinking of the effect they want to create with their own speculative projects.
<br>
There are many methods to construct speculative scenarios. for instance, it is possible to start with the large political and social structures that make up a world and fill in details from there on. it is also possible to start with a single idea, which you then extrapolate the bigger structures from. 
<br>
Science fiction is a genre of fantastic tales that seeks plausibility against a background of science. Science fiction makes use of a valuable trick. It combines spectacular, high-adventure storylines with more in-depth intellectual layers. The spectacular layer keeps the reader's attention, while the deeper layers often make the reader reflect on ethical or philosophical questions about technology.
<br>
Graphic design is often seen as a very practical and commercial discipline, this is seen as a bad thing. However, if we look at successful speculative projects made by graphic designers, we notice the designers managed to use this practical and commercial in their advantage. Graphic design known the language of the general public. This can be exploited to involve a broad audience in the reflections upon the worlds of tomorrow.
