SPECULATIVE GRAPHIC DESIGN</p>

<p>
Initially, the term speculative design wasn’t welcomed by graphic designers with great enthusiasm. Speculative design reminded graphic designers too much of the graphic design term “spec design”  [1]. The “spec” in spec design stands for speculative as well, but refers to the financial definition of speculation. Spec design is a way of working where the client asks for examples of the design before agreeing on a fee. Mostly, spec design assignments involve a group of candidates competing for the job. The clients asks everyone to send an (often low res, or blurred) example of a proposal to decide who will give the job.<br>
This kind of design is called speculative because the candidate designers invest time in designing a proposal with a high risk of being turned down. Spec design as a way of working has been getting lots of critique. It gives too much power to the client, minimizes the role of the knowledge and taste of the designer. makes the design process overly superficial and doesn’t create an open space of fruitful client-designer collaboration.
<br><br>
Despite the bad connotations that came with the term. Graphic Designers have been thinking of what speculative design can mean for graphic design. In 2014, a selection of prominent graphic design studios held an exhibition in the SOMArts Cultural Center in San Francisco, All Possible Futures [16]. This show explored the possibilities of speculation in the field of graphic design.<br>
In the exhibition catalog Jon Sueda researches what speculation means for graphic designers. It features interviews with and text by graphic designers that explore their experiences with and thoughts on speculation. From the start of this publication it becomes apparent the interpretation of speculative is different from Dunne & Raby’s. Sueda explains:
<br><br>
“The works in All Possible Futures embody a wide range of approaches to the idea of speculation. They encompass everything from self-generated provocations to experimental work created ‘in parallel’ with client-based projects to unique situations where commissions have been tackled with a high level of autonomy and critical investigation … Some projects were made for clients and exist in a real-world context, while others might otherwise have gone unnoticed: failed proposals, formal experiments, sketches, incomplete thoughts” 
<br><br>
It seems like Sueda includes everything that isn’t a conventional commercial design solution.<br>
His examples also show this. Sueda starts the publication with an anecdote about designer Peter Bil’ak. Bil’ak presented a client a proposal for a new visual identity, the identity however, challenges the conventional way we look at a visual identity, and moreover, the technology for realising his project doesn’t exist yet. The client in the end rejects the proposal. Sueda calls this proposal speculative. Bil’ak rethinks the conventional visual identity, resulting in thinking of a new tool. The proposal gets rejected so stays in the “not yet”.<br>
Other examples Sueda names are the work of Ed Fella, a designer that started to making non-commercial work parallel to his commercial work, and Dexter Sinister’s Meta-the-difference-between-the-2-Font-4-D, a font featured in the exhibition. The font started off as a self-initiated project in 2010 but was adopted by Kadist Art Foundation in 2013. At this point the font stops being speculative, Sueda argues.
<br><br>
Sueda points out the practical or commercial image of graphic design restricts its possibilities. There always needs to be a client, offering money, for a project to start and clients mostly like to pay for conventional designs, not to much experimentation. Remarkably a lot of the projects featured in All Possible Futures are very much tied to this criticized commercial practice. They are still products a designer would make for a client, like a typeface or a visual identity. <br>
In comparison, Dunne & Raby’s projects are all completely detached from commercial clients. The client might be a museum or other exhibition space but the promotion of this client is never the main goal. The main goal is making people think about future scenario’s. The “design” is used as a tool to accomplish this goal. <br>
In graphic design, the equivalent of this way of working would mean: using graphic design as a tool to make people think of future scenario’s. So, using the knowledge and techniques graphic design distinguishes itself with from other design disciplines. Very practical, this could mean, posters, books, and websites/apps.<br><br>

A studio using Graphic Design in this way is Next Nature Network [17]. Next Nature Network researches the changing relationship between nature and technology. To make people think about the way nature and technology are coevolving they make use of objects, but also of graphic design formats like the website and the book.<br>
An perfect example of such a project is the In Vitro Meat Cookbook. This project questions how lab-grown meat could solve environmental issues, reduce animal suffering and change our food culture. The project does this by, in the shape of a cookbook, show 48 innovative future ‘recipes”.
