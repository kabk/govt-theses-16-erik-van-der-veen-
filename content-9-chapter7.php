Speculative Graphic Design

</p>

<p>

Initially, the term speculative design wasn’t welcomed by graphic designers with great enthusiasm. Speculative design reminded graphic designers too much of the graphic design term “spec design” [1]. The “spec” in spec design stands for speculative as well, but refers to the financial definition of speculation. Spec design is a way of working where the client asks for examples of the design before agreeing on a fee [45]. Mostly, spec design assignments involve a group of candidates competing for the job. The clients asks everyone to send an (often low res, or blurred) example of a proposal to decide who will get the job.
<br>
This kind of design is called speculative, because the candidate designers invest time in designing a proposal with a high risk of being turned down. Spec design as a way of working has been getting lots of critique. It gives too much power to the client, minimizes the role of the knowledge and taste of the designer, makes the design process overly superficial and doesn’t create an open space of fruitful client-designer collaboration.
<br>

<br>
Despite the bad connotations that came with the term, there has been a graphic design exhibition around this theme. In 2014, a selection of prominent graphic design studios held an exhibition in the SOMArts Cultural Center in San Francisco, <i><span id="apf">All Possible Futures</span></i> [46]. This show claimed to explore the possibilities of speculation in the field of graphic design.
<br>
In the exhibition <span id="apf2">catalog</span>, Jon Sueda researches what speculation means for graphic designers[1]. It features interviews with and text by graphic designers that explore their experiences with and thoughts on speculation. From the start of this publication, it becomes apparent the interpretation of speculative is different from Dunne & Raby’s. Sueda explains:
<br>

<br>
“<i>The works in All Possible Futures embody a wide range of approaches to the idea of speculation. They encompass everything from self-generated provocations to experimental work created ‘in parallel’ with client-based projects to unique situations where commissions have been tackled with a high level of autonomy and critical investigation … Some projects were made for clients and exist in a real-world context, while others might otherwise have gone unnoticed: failed proposals, formal experiments, sketches, incomplete thoughts.</i>” 
<br>

<br>
It seems like Sueda includes everything that isn’t a conventional commercial design solution.
<br>
His examples also show this. Sueda starts the publication with an anecdote about designer Peter Bil’ak. Bil’ak presented a client a proposal for a new visual identity. The identity however, challenges the conventional way we look at a visual identity, and moreover, the technology for realising his project doesn’t exist yet. The client in the end rejected the proposal. Sueda calls this proposal speculative. Bil’ak rethinks the conventional visual identity, resulting in thinking of a new tool. The proposal gets rejected so stays in the “not yet”.
<br>
Other examples Sueda names are the work of Ed Fella, a designer that started to making non-commercial work parallel to his commercial work, and Dexter Sinister’s Meta-the-difference-between-the-2-Font-4-D, a font featured in the exhibition. The font started off as a self-initiated project in 2010 but was adopted by Kadist Art Foundation in 2013. At this point the font stopped being speculative, it is argued in the publication.
<br>

<br>
Sueda points out the commercial image of graphic design limits its possibilities. There always needs to be a client, offering money, for a project to start. Clients mostly pay for conventional designs, not for a risky experimental design. Remarkably a lot of the projects featured in All Possible Futures are very much tied to this criticized commercial practice. They are still products a designer would make for a client, like a typeface or a visual identity.
<br>
In comparison, Dunne & Raby’s projects are all completely detached from commercial clients. The client might be a museum or other exhibition space but the promotion of this client is never the main goal. The main goal is to make people think about future scenarios. The “design” is used as a tool to accomplish this goal. 
<br>
In graphic design, the equivalent of this way of working would mean: using graphic design as a tool to make people think of future scenarios. So, using the knowledge and techniques graphic design distinguishes itself with from other design disciplines. Very practical, this could mean, posters, books, and websites/apps.
<br>

<br>
So it almost seems All Possible Futures hijacked the term <i>speculative</i> to gather a variety of big graphic design names and exhibit an incoherent range of experimental works. Luckily, there are studios that use graphic design to speculate about the future: Metahaven and Next Nature Network. 
<br>

<br>
Metahaven is a studio for design and research. In its projects Metahaven often designs commercial corporate identities for existing (like Wikileaks and the self-proclaimed sovereign state of Sealand) and non-existing institutions to deliver social and political commentary [46]. <i><span id="facestate">Facestate</span></i> was a project of Metahaven in which they present a scenario where a social media platform becomes the government (or the other way around)[3][47]. The project both explores possibilities, poses warnings and relates to contemporary topics like social media, politics, transparency and privacy. Metahaven uses graphic design as a tool to present this idea, in this example, by designing the identity of the social-media/government Facestate.
<br>
The corporate identity is in graphic design a well-known “product”, often associated with the most commercial side of the profession. The corporate identity of a company tells who they are and what they stand for. With this commercial and ideological meaning of the identity, it lends itself as vessel for social or political critique. This is a good example of how graphic designers can use their expertise to make speculative projects.
<br>

<br>
Another studio using graphic design tools to show future speculations is <span id="nnn">Next</span> Nature Network [48]. Next Nature Network researches the changing relationship between nature and technology. They make use of objects, but also of graphic design formats like the website and the book to make people think about the way nature and technology are coevolving.
<br>
An perfect example of such a project is the <i><span id="invitro">In</span> Vitro Meat Cookbook</i>[49]. This project questions how lab-grown meat could solve environmental issues, reduce animal suffering and change our food culture. The project does this by, in the shape of a cookbook, showing 48 innovative and thought provoking future “recipes”. 
<br>
The cookbook is a format that for graphic designers has a familiar language. So as with the corporate identity, it could be used as a vessel for speculative ideas. What is smart about the format of a cookbook in particular is that it is an already familiar format to the public. This makes the project accessible for a broad audience. 
<br>
We see this approach more often in projects of Next Nature. In another project they wanted to question the future of nanotechnology [50]. To get the audience to think, they developed hypothetical consumer products that were exhibited in a supermarket <span id="nanobus">bus</span>. Nanotechnology is an abstract topic for the general public, but by talking about it in a mundane format: the language of supermarket corporate identity, brochures and commercials, Next Nature succeeds to make the topic graspable.
<br>

<br>
Sueda may claim the commercial image limits graphic designs possibilities, but he also overlooks the advantage the commercial knowledge gives the designer. The graphic designer is familiar with the language that stands closest to the general public, the graphic design knows how to sell ideas.
