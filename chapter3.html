ON SPECULATIVE DESIGN</p>

<p>
So the question remains: what is speculative design? I’ll have to start with a disclaimer. Speculative design isn’t a clear cut genre and at the same time it is. It is not something new. Designers made work that involved speculation long before speculative design became a thing. However, it has lately been getting more attention as a genre in itself. Furthermore, people have been using the term to describe their own practice. <br>
The attention speculative design has been getting is largely attributable to the publishing of Dunne and Raby’s book Speculative Everything in 2013. In their book they offer a clear view on what speculative design is to them. They substantiate this view with examples from past and present design projects from different disciplines. The book isn't a manifest, it defines speculative design in a rather open way, yet it delimits the genre enough to specify various methods of dealing with speculative design.
	To Dunne and Raby speculative design is a way of thinking of big problems like climate change, overpopulation and water shortage with design [2]. Critical design (a design genre earlier coined by Dunne and Raby) has been fruitful in thinking of- and critiquing society, it has been less active in looking for solutions. Speculative design uses the critical design ways of thinking but also opens up new fields. It could be a place to dream of new worlds, find alternatives to our current way of doing things. <br>
	Speculative design often talks about the future. Dunne & Raby acknowledge nevertheless predicting the future is a pointless exercise. The co-evolution of technology and humans has so many facets and factors that we can’t calculate or foresee their trajectory. What we can do is think of all the possible scenarios. Dunne and Raby use this graph to explain the relationship between the future and speculative practices. <br><br>

[include graph]

We can think of all the possible futures. This is a lot, according to our current understandings of science only precognition and perpetual motion are impossible. Inside the possible we find the plausible and the probable. The space of the plausible holds all alternatives to our current economical and political structures. The probable is the space we usually operate inside. Dunne and Raby’s practice lies on the edge of the plausible and the probable, in a field they call preferable. The preferable is a difficult term. It might be different from person to person. As said before: What might be heaven for one might be hell for another. Currently we let capitalist mechanics for a large part tell us what we want. Speculative design is a way we can explore the future. It could offer us triggering alternatives, make us think of what it is we really want, be a catalyst of change. To Dunne and Raby this is what design should focus on. They have seen, after the financial crash of 2008, peoples interest in hearing new alternatives grew. They believe design should take this opportunity to not only question but also offer new values, systems and ideologies.<br><br>

As said before this isn’t the first time designers think about the future. In all design disciplines future speculation has happened before. 
	Architecture has probably the richest history in this field. Studios like Archigram, Archizoom and Superstudio are usually the first to be named. Visionary architecture is a genre of architecture with a social, critical and political agenda that experiments with not only designing buildings but also the cultures that would live within them. This genre is often jokingly called “paper architecture” because the buildings will never be realised, they will stay on paper. Other disciplines have had speculative practices. From futuristic fashion design, critical furniture and car prototypes.<br><br>
	
Dunne & Raby don’t want design to be merely a style option, corporate propaganda or a designer’s self-promotion. The sum-up other purposes for social engaged design:<br><br>

- Raising awareness<br>
- Satire <br>
- Critique<br>
- Inspiration<br>
- Reflection<br>
- Highbrow entertainment<br>
- Aesthetic exploration<br>
- A catalyst for change<br><br>

Critique is to them the most interesting of this list. Critical design is frequently misinterpreted as plain critique, a negative attitude towards the world or a hollow aesthetic justified by intellectual sounding texts. To Dunne & Raby, critical design is more than this. people often mistake critique and commentary. Being critical to them is more a way looking at things, being sceptical, not taking the existing for granted. In design, this approach doesn’t have to stop at commenting and saying what’s not good or up for improvement. It could also talk about possibilities, dreams, desires, it may be wishful thinking as long as it adds something. This approach is especially becoming important in a world in which technological innovations continuously change and question the world around us. <br>
We can’t sit back and accept mindlessly. We have to express what we want. People often don’t see the power they have as consumers to change the world. A lot of people are aware of the problems the world of today is facing. When asked for solutions they often indicate they feel powerless. People have to understand as consumers they have to be critical as well. As consumers we construct reality by buying it. If we stop buying thing that harm the planet, these products will disappear. If we buy products we believe in, and other will too. The market will shift to these products and the world could change.<br>
This is especially important now we’re living in a time where much more is becoming possible. Genetic modification, synthetic biology, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence, both knowledge and techniques are improving faster. This changes the way we live, interact and look at the world but do we take enough time to reflect on these processes? Nowadays everybody is constantly connected to the web by the supercomputers we wear close to our bodies. But if we would have known this was going to be our future 20 years ago, and had a time to think about it before hand, would we still have come up with the same device? The same could be said for, for instance, nanotechnology of genetic modification. It’s now mainly in the lab but when it will hit the market, do we want to think about the implications beforehand, or do we just let it happen and see the consequences later? Speculative design can be the bridge between the consumer and it’s future products. By showing various futures we can challenge the consumer to reflect on the worlds and products of tomorrow.

Speculative design methods<br>
Design usually turns to classical art disciplines and social sciences when looking for design methods. Speculative design is not necessarily bound to the world as we already know it. It methods can be more experimental as long as it serves it’s purpose. Speculative design can broaden the design because it relies more on imagination. Dunne & Raby describe a various approaches. <br><br>

Fictional worlds<br>
Speculative design can involve the creation of fictional worlds. Literature and film (and recently video games) are the most suitable and familiar media for showing these kind of worlds. In literature and film multiple aspects of fictional worlds can be described, the environments, architecture, the political structure, social interaction. In other disciplines the design challenge is to invite to viewer to visualise these worlds in their own imagination. <br>
Popular science fiction, cinema and videogames usually create fictional world for means of entertainment and escapism. They mostly focus on setting, geology and environment while speculative design could focus on culture and ideology. <br><br>

Utopia/Dystopia<br>
Here the idea of the utopia and dystopia reappears. The utopia can function as an example of a perfect society. Some people see utopia’s as dangerous concepts because Fascism, Nazism and Stalinism originated from utopic thinking. So in showing the utopia, it should be kept in mind that it’s only a representation and not a goal for reality. <br>
The dystopia can be used as a precaution. To show what could happen to the world if we are not carefull. Pedro Oliveira and Luiza Prado have noted that when creating a dystopia, one should question if this dystopia isn’t already existing outside western world. When overlooking this, the designer could risk being seen as a plain western-minded fool.<br><br>

Extrapolation<br>
It can be useful to take an detail from modern life and enlarged it to an extreme scale. This is in the past for instance done often by enlarging modern capitalism to the point that people start living in advertisement. Extrapolation can have a double effect, making us reflect on both aout the world we live in today and the future at the same time. An example of this is the British tv-show black mirror. The show showed exaggerations of phenomena connected to smartphone- and social media use. The show succeeded in making people aware of present issues surrounding this topic and asked for a precaution attitude towards the future. <br><br>

Thought Experiments<br>
A thought experiment could serve as way to help think about difficult problems in a structured manner. It’s a method mostly used in philosophy and mathematics. In a thought experiment you start with a set of rules or limitations. From here you start building a world or concept using the pre-set conditions. <br><br>

Reductio ad absurdum<br>
In reductio ad absurdum you try to prove a statement is false by taking its implications to the extreme. This method could lead to humorful outcomes that put the initial statement to question. Although Dunne & Raby don’t connect this method directly to speculative design, it still could be a useful way in thinking of unforeseen outcomes and implications. <br><br>

Counterfactuals<br>
In this form of experiment you think of something that is not true but imagine about what would happen if it were true. For instance, what would have happened if people during the french revolutions had smartphones? what would happen when bob ross taught people how to to code? <br><br>

What Ifs<br>
What if is the most straightforward question in speculative design, maybe even the most important one. What If? was even the title of the, speculative design themed, 2015 Dutch Design Week. The event was promoted with posters stating “what if’s” like: “What if my toilet could talk to my doctor?”, What if time could be stored in a battery?”. That’s exactly what the method does, start a question with what if, and think of the implications of the what if. From this starting point the designer could start building a concept or narrative.<br><br>

Fictioneers in denial <br>
Dunne & Raby claim “design has become so absorbed in industry, so familiar with the dream s of industry, that it’s almost impossible to dream its own dreams”. If a designer want to go into speculation, he/she should to a certain level go into a deliberate state of denialism. The world as we know it dictates us what to do and how to do it. We should be able to deny what we know set ourselves free from conventions and commercial design practice. If designers are able to do this, “we might see the beginning of a theoretical form of design dedicated to thinking, reflecting, inspiring, and providing new perspectives on some of the challenges facing us.” as MoMa currator Poala Antonelli suggests.
