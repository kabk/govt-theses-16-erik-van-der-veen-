Props ≠ Products

So the question remains: what is <span id="spec">speculative</span> design? The term speculative design was popularized by designers Dunne & Raby in their book <i>Speculative Everything</i> in 2013 [3]. In their book they offer a clear view on what speculative design is to them. They substantiate this view with examples from past and present design projects from different disciplines. The book isn't a manifesto, it defines speculative design in a rather open way, yet it delimits the genre enough to specify various methods of dealing with speculative design.
<br>
To Dunne & Raby, speculative design is a way of thinking of big problems like climate change, overpopulation and water shortage with design. Critical design (a design genre earlier coined by Dunne & Raby) has been fruitful in reflecting upon- and critiquing society. However, it has been less active in looking for solutions. Speculative design uses the critical design ways of thinking but also opens up new fields. It could be a place to dream of new worlds, find alternatives to our current way of doing things. 
<br>

<br>
In <i>Speculative Everything</i>, Dunne & Raby sum up the functions speculative design can have. Not so coincidentally, these include functions we have already seen in the historical examples of speculation: raising awareness, satire, critique, inspiration, reflection, highbrow entertainment, aesthetic exploration and a catalyst for change. To Dunne & Raby, Critique and catalysing change are the most important ones. Consumerist capitalism as we know it already puts a large strain on our environment. At the same time, new technologies start being developed that will change the world as we know it even further. If product designers will be more critical on what they design and consumers on what they buy, we together could start a change. Speculative design could explore the future possibilities in a critical way to make us reflect on the now and think of what we want in the future.

<br>
Dunne & Raby describe a couple of methods to start speculating: 
<br>
<i>Fictional worlds</i> can be a good way to speculate from a top-down perspective. You start with a few general assumptions about, for instance, governmental structure, climate or technological advancement and then imagine what this would imply for the world. Very clear types of fictional worlds is are the <i>utopia</i> and <i>dystopia</i>. 
<br>
A more bottom-up way of speculating is starting with a detail and then <i>extrapolating</i> from there. blowing it up, starting at a detail and deriving a whole world from it. An example of extrapolating is the British tv-show <i>Black Mirror</i> [19]. The show envisioned exaggerations of phenomena connected to smartphone- and social media use. Starting from a single aspect and then inventing a whole universe that would fit its consequences.
<br>
A very structured way of reflecting upon a complicated problem is with a <i>thought experiment</i>. It’s a method mostly used in philosophy and mathematics. In a thought experiment you start with a set of rules or limitations. From here you start building a world or concept using the pre-set conditions. 
<br>
In <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> you try to prove a statement is false by taking its implications to the extreme. This method could lead to humorful outcomes that put the initial statement to question. Although Dunne & Raby don’t connect this method directly to speculative design, it still could be a useful way in thinking of unforeseen outcomes and implications. 
<br>
You could also start with something that is true and then asking yourself what would happen if it were different. An example: What would happen when bob ross taught people how to code? This is what is called a <i>counterfactual</i>. a brother of the counter is the <i>What if</i>. What ifs look like counterfactuals but they are more forward-looking. Maybe it’s the most important question of speculative design. “<i>What If?</i>” was even the title of the speculative design themed Dutch Design Week in 2015. The event was promoted with posters stating “what ifs” like: “What if my toilet could talk to my doctor?”, What if time could be stored in a battery?” [44].
<br>

<br>
An example of a project of Dunne & Raby is <i>Designs for an Overpopulated Planet, No. 1, Foragers</i> [3][44]. In this project, Dunne & Raby assumed there will be a future of overpopulation and governments that did not care about feeding everyone. People would start to come up with innovative solutions themselves. In this case, a series of <span id="forg1">prosthetic</span> devices that functioned as extensions of the digestive system. With these body-augmenting devices the foragers, as Dunne & Raby called these future innovative inventors, could extract nutrients from their environment that people nowadays have no access to. 
<br>
To show this scenario. Dunne & Raby designed the devices these foragers would wear/use. As with other projects of Dunne & Raby, these objects serve more as props rather than prototypes. “<i>It was very important that they clearly signaled their unreality so that the viewers were aware they were looking at ideas, not products.</i>”, They say themselves. The objects were shown in use on a series of photographs and a video <span id="forg3">animation</span>. The pictures showed the foragers in nature but wearing <span id="forg2">sporty</span> clothes to break the expectations that this community of people would be an isolated anti-technology cult. 
<br>

<br>
It’s interesting to see how Dunne & Raby approach the materialisation of their scenarios. It shows an intelligent way of designing the object and presenting it. Nevertheless, it still feels very abstract and less accessible for a broad audience compared to literature.
